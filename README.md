# Tic-Tac-Toe-react (XO Game)

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React.js. The game allows two players to select either "X" or "O", enter their names, and play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game keeps track of each player's moves and displays a message when a player wins, loses, or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Players can select their symbol ("X" or "O") and enter their names.
- The game board updates in real-time as players choose their moves.
- A list below the grid shows each move made by the players, including the row and column of the selected cell.
- A pop-up message appears to announce the result when a player wins, loses, or when the game ends in a draw.
